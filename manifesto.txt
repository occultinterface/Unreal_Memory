My sleeping brain, a generative machine, creating stories and colours and deeply emotive scenes. To the night, the spirits often whisper those things the day is not ready to listen to.

Your visions are a source of insight and inspiration, but they hide behind a screen of forgetting. Each morning I cross the black mirror back to reality and leave them behind, lodged beyond my conscious mind. Each evening the vessel is filled, then emptied, stumbling on a delete key when returning. I wish to rise with recall of your stories, dream-image still imprinted in my eyelids.

To illuminate the interlude between night and day with the unreal memory of an unconscious dreamscape. And to bring this memory into reality, generating an artefact of visual poetry.
