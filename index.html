  <h1>Unreal Memory</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>My sleeping brain, a generative machine.</h2>
    <p>
      At night my mind reates stories and colours and deeply emotive scenes. To the it, the spirits often whisper things the day is not ready to listen to.

      <p>

        Your visions are a source of insight and inspiration, but they hide behind a screen of forgetting. Each morning I cross the black mirror back to reality and leave them behind, lodged beyond my conscious mind. Each evening the vessel is
        filled,
        then emptied, stumbling on a delete key when returning. I wish to rise with recall of your stories, dream-image still imprinted in my eyelids.</p>

      <p>

        To illuminate the interlude between night and day with the unreal memory of an unconscious dreamscape. And to bring this memory into reality, generating an artefact of visual poetry.
